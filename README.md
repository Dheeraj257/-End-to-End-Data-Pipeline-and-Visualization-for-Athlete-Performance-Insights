Athlete Performance Insights: End-to-End Data Pipeline & Dashboard

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis pipeline — from raw web data to interactive performance visualizations — showcasing key data wrangling, transformation, and BI reporting skills.

---

Project Overview

- Extracted raw athlete performance data from a public website and saved it in Excel format.
- Imported the data into a Jupyter Notebook and performed extensive cleaning and transformation using **Python** and **Pandas**.
- Exported the cleaned dataset and loaded it into a **MySQL** database for structured querying.
- Analyzed performance metrics using **SQL**, focusing on regional and sport-specific KPIs.
- Connected the MySQL database to **Tableau** and developed interactive dashboards to visualize trends and assist in decision-making.
